Data Science  (Forked!)
===========
I use this repository for my projects about data science and statistical inference. The main projects are

 - [covid19 monitoring notebook](python/covid19-monitoring-notebook.ipynb) is a single notebook in python that monitors the spread of the 
    virus in some European countries. 
 - [Statistical Learning](r/stat_learning/chapter1.ipynb) is a collection of notebooks in R with my notes about a course on 
statistical inference and worked out examples taken from the book used in the course. 
 - [Bayesian Inference](r/rethinking/probability.ipynb) is a collection 
of notes about probability and bayesian inference and R scripts taken 
from the books I am using for this project.
